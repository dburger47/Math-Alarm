# Math-Alarm
uCtrl Fall 2024 Final Project

Welcome,

The math alarm clock uses an Arduino, Real Time Clock Module, 4x4 keypad matrix, and a 2x16 LCD screen. This clock functions like a normal clock, but to stop the alarm, the user must answer a few math problems. The math problems are displayed in multiple-choice format, meaning the user must select the correct problem that gives a set answer.
